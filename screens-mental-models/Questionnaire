 2. Processing Printed words and non-words:
 	-English (left-hand superior)

 3. Split Brain Patients:
 	-Epillepsy
 	-Electrical disturbance (couldn't spread hemispheres)

How do these subjects of study relate to what interaction design studies?

 It relates in regard to users' mental models as well and how people process the visual word
 	-Right hemisphere (processing global features)
 	-Left hemisphere (processing small details)

Give at least two specific methods used by cognitive psychologists to study or learn about their subjects:

 2. Ask patients to describe how they perceive photos and analyze what scale of focus they had obn their description

How do these methods of study relate to how interaction design research is performed?

 Interaction design research is conducted through user tests as well. Users are asked to perform certain tasks on the given technology and a comparison is made based on each user's response
